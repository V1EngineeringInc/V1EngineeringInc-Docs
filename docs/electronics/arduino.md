# Firmware

!!! note
If you're looking to flash Marlin Firmware for a V1Engineering machine, start [here](../electronics/marlin-firmware.md).

Marlin Firmware is moving away from the Arduino IDE and has started using [PlatformIO](../learn/platformio.md).

But these arduino instructions may be useful for someone, so we have archived them here. Some of the details may be out of date.

??? "Archived Arduino IDE instructions"
### Using GitHub

You will find this on the [V1 Engineering Marlin GitHub](https://github.com/Allted/Marlin) page. 

| In case you have never used GitHub, the first drop down lets you select the firmware version you want. | The next step is download the firmware you selected. Click on “Clone or Download”, then click on “Download Zip”. |

### Naming key

All versions have the full graphic LCD enabled. I can add links to all of these if it is still unclear.

**Machine type_Board_Details**

_Machine type_– MP3DP, V1CNC=MPCNC & LowRider, ZenXY

_Boards_– Mini-Roambo, Full Rambo, Archim1, Archim2, Ramps

_Details_– 16T=16tooth pulley, T8=Leadscrew type, 16/32step=Step rate the firmware is set to, Dual Endstop=MPCNC specific edits, Aero/MK=base extruders they are set to.

### Marlin Change log

1/20/20 - 418, Arcs fixed, more default current fresh start from 2.0.1+

4/27/19 – 401-402, 600+changes (Marlin catch up), enabled eeprom, lowered Z accel (MPCNC/LowRider), driver fixes.

12/17/18 – 303 Archim1 boards only, LCD/USB fix. Thanks Jason&Ultimachine.

11/28/18 – 302

- Added 3 menus, G92 XYZ, Home Z, Home XY. (Maybe I should use “Zero” instead of home or reference :p)
- No easy workaround for the flashing ???’s…The “[right way](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/7342)”
- Dual firmware’s get disable softstop menus.
- 20 minute stepper hold after activation / gcode completion.
- Remember G0, G1, G2…. (might help with poor post processors) Can’t enable the G0 default rapids because we need a separate for the Z axis. If I enable this by default we would be working with the Z max unless otherwise specified in the gcode. Might be a good thing.
- Junction deviation set at smoothie recommended 0.005 for CNC’s (gunna need some testing).
- Enabled S_Curve_deviation.
- LCD timeout set to 45 seconds instead of 15.
- CNC coordinate systems enabled.
- Added a little versioning number to the LCD boot screen or repetier connect info. This will help easily identify what firmware people are using and if there are ever issues we can flag it.

## Smoothie

The X and Y steppers are wired in series (or parallel) and wired to a single port. The picture below
is an example of a board running smoothieware. Many other boards are available.

Here is my Pre-Configured Basic config file.

This is just me getting my feet wet and there are a lot of other options you can add to the file.

**This is for 32nd stepping, 16 Tooth Pulleys and  5/16″ threaded rod.**

Config for smoothie boards..[config](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/config.zip)

### Change log

9/15/16- Initial release

## GRBL

The X and Y steppers are wired in series (or parallel) and wired to a single port. The picture below
is an example of a board running GRBL. Many other boards are available. First board I ever
bought…..one of these days…

Sorry I do not have a config for this yet.

## How to Flash

### How to flash firmware on the Mini-Rambo (or Rambo)

- Install the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) software and its drivers **before** you plug in your board.
- You will then need to plug in both **USB and 12V power.**
- Unzip the firmware you need from above
- Open arduino
- Sketch-Include Library-Manage Libraries

- Type “U8glib” in the search box, hit enter, select U8glib, select the number with the highest
version, Install. This has never been easier.
