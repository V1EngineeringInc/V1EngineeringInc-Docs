# Firmware
Firmware is the program or software “embedded/burned/flashed” into the electronics board, this is what
translates the gcode into motion in the stepper motors. There are many types of firmware we mainly use Marlin.

## Marlin

![!pic](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Marlin-Logo-GitHub.png)

The boards sold here are using the [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) Firmware. Only
minor changes have been made to run any machine. If you bought your electronics from here this has
already been done for you initially, you can use this document to change or update your control board.

The firmware is what makes this all possible and was the key for me to quickly make all sorts of
robots. For a while now [Scott – “ThinkyHead”](https://www.patreon.com/thinkyhead/posts) has been the ring leader for all the great developers
working on the Marlin project. He is not the only one but has been a huge factor in getting the
firmware to the place it is now. 

??? "Dual Endstops & Auto squaring"
    This is an advanced feature and the information will be kept separately for the time being,
    [HERE](../dual-endstops).

### GitHub Firmware

The newest "stable" release we have been working on are found at the link below. These files are preconfigured for various control boards and machine configurations.

[Github pre-configured firmware repository.](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/MarlinBuilder/releases), or the [Marlin Releases Page.](.../marlin-releases.md)

If you want bleeding edge, you can head to the "actions" tab and see all nightly marlin bugfix builds along with pull request builds testing new features or settings. 

### Editing, Compiling, and Programming the Control Board

Right now editing and flashing (programming / burning) your control board with Marlin 2.0 requires using [PlatformIO](../learn/platformio.md) This has proven to be easier than the Arduino IDE we used to use for most people.

### Just updating a standard build

Ramps, Rambo, Mini-Rambo, and possibly other boards can be quickly flashed with [Xloader.](https://github.com/xinabox/xLoader)
SKR Pro boards can be updated by adding the new firmware.bin file to the microSD card on the board and rebooting. A little green LED will flash for a few seconds and it is done.

### Options

Depending on what type of control board you use you might have other firmware options. Many firmware versions are fairly board specific though. There could be a long list here, instead may we suggest having a look in the forums to see what others have tried out and if it might be a better option for your specific use case.

    ### Using GitHub

    You will find this on the [V1 Engineering Marlin GitHub](https://github.com/Allted/Marlin) page. 

    | In case you have never used GitHub, the first drop down lets you select the firmware version you want. | The next step is download the firmware you selected. Click on “Clone or Download”, then click on “Download Zip”. |

    ### Naming key

    All versions have the full graphic LCD enabled. I can add links to all of these if it is still unclear.

    **Machine type_Board_Details**

    _Machine type_– MP3DP, V1CNC=MPCNC & LowRider, ZenXY

    _Boards_– Mini-Roambo, Full Rambo, Archim1, Archim2, Ramps

    _Details_– 16T=16tooth pulley, T8=Leadscrew type, 16/32step=Step rate the firmware is set to, Dual Endstop=MPCNC specific edits, Aero/MK=base extruders they are set to.

    ### Marlin Change log

    1/20/20 - 418, Arcs fixed, more default current fresh start from 2.0.1+

    4/27/19 – 401-402, 600+changes (Marlin catch up), enabled eeprom, lowered Z accel (MPCNC/LowRider), driver fixes.

    12/17/18 – 303 Archim1 boards only, LCD/USB fix. Thanks Jason&Ultimachine.

    11/28/18 – 302

    - Added 3 menus, G92 XYZ, Home Z, Home XY. (Maybe I should use “Zero” instead of home or reference :p)
    - No easy workaround for the flashing ???’s…The “[right way](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/7342)”
    - Dual firmware’s get disable softstop menus.
    - 20 minute stepper hold after activation / gcode completion.
    - Remember G0, G1, G2…. (might help with poor post processors) Can’t enable the G0 default rapids because we need a separate for the Z axis. If I enable this by default we would be working with the Z max unless otherwise specified in the gcode. Might be a good thing.
    - Junction deviation set at smoothie recommended 0.005 for CNC’s (gunna need some testing).
    - Enabled S_Curve_deviation.
    - LCD timeout set to 45 seconds instead of 15.
    - CNC coordinate systems enabled.
    - Added a little versioning number to the LCD boot screen or repetier connect info. This will help easily identify what firmware people are using and if there are ever issues we can flag it.

    ## Smoothie

    The X and Y steppers are wired in series (or parallel) and wired to a single port. The picture below
    is an example of a board running smoothieware. Many other boards are available.

    Here is my Pre-Configured Basic config file.

    This is just me getting my feet wet and there are a lot of other options you can add to the file.

    **This is for 32nd stepping, 16 Tooth Pulleys and  5/16″ threaded rod.**

    Config for smoothie boards..[config](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/config.zip)
