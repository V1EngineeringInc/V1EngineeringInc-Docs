# Frequently Asked Questions

## Intro to FAQ 101

V1 Engineering's goal is to provide an easy to source CNC platform for whatever tools users want. Part of that goal is to have a clearly defined path to get from idea to fully functional machine, as inexpensively as possible. With that said, our new users tend to be very new to nearly every aspect of this. Jeffeb3 coined the term, Yellow Brick Road. This simply means recommend whatever the instructions say, so the new user is not presented with more questions, complications, and fewer people to help.

After a user has *at least* successfully made a test crown, then maybe help them stray off the path.

### FAQ 201

This is not to say everything in the instructions is the best, most correct, easiest, perfect, whatever. This is the path that all users can follow to get to the goal of a test crown and then some cuts. The instructions are based on these parts, items, settings, and have been tested. Using the newest and best stuff might be better, but not by much and far fewer people to help use them. If you have an issue with something in the instructions, let's all discuss it, outside the new users thread, and see if changing the instructions is worth it, or maybe why the instructions say what they do.

### An example

"Hey, I just got a new 3D printer. Do I really need to use 40% infill? That seems like a lot, and it is going to take forever."
A good answer is "It is best to stick with the recommendations as they have been tested, we know it works." Or "It is a good idea to go with what we know works"
A bad answer is "If you increase your printer's accelerations, replace the nozzle with a larger diameter, get a bigger heater, use high flow filament, and decrease the infill by 10% you will save a ton of time."

## The FAQ's

Rule #1 - Do not ask why this is better than that or why we chose something. You are asking us to defend a decision that was made long ago and put in work that we already did when the decision was made. If you think your thing/idea/setting is better lead with a detailed description of why you think it is better. We get pelted with questions about everything, and I mean everything, it gets old. On the flip side we love learning about new and better things. This probably needs to be in the forums not here.

Control boards - Any control board will work. A 5 driver board is recommended for the CNC machines now so we can auto-square both axes. With that said, the boards recommended by V1 Engineering have a very active user base that is testing all aspects and random use cases. If you have a question, most users here can help you. Using any other board means you will be responsible for your own firmware and testing, mounting solutions, and wiring.

Firmware - You can use any firmware you want. Our Boards have precompiled firmware that works with most common use cases. Using any other firmware means you have far fewer people to help. Even people that know your firmware will mostly likely be uninterested in trying to compile things for a board they can not test. Feel free to ask questions but know you are mostly on your own.

Filament - PLA is recommended for its rigidity, dimensional accuracy, and print-ability. You can use any filament you want, no one will stop you. No other filament will 100% fit all three categories as well as PLA. The best and most expensive filament might be slightly more rigid, far more expensive, much harder to print, need special equipment to print and in the end offer no real world gains. The only reason we offer special filament is for added heat resistance at the cost of rigidity.

Print Settings -  The parts are design and tested as listed in the instructions. You can use any wall count you want, any infill pattern, or density you want, very little will change in terms of part performance. Straying from what is recommended will most likely just result in a lesser print. Best case, you find the magic formula and gain 2% more rigidity.

Pendants - It is best to try the machines as they are in the instructions. We can all follow along and help you if you get stuck. Any add on controller adds significant cost, complexity, firmware edits and dramatically lowers the amount of people that can help you. It is fine if you want one, but please try it as designed first. Marlin boards are compatible with very inexpensive LCD screens, FluidNC boards have a built-in, customizable, theme-able web page that allows to have control over every aspect of the machine and firmware wirelessly and are free from any web enabled device.

Tables - Any roughly flat surface will work. Build your CNC machine, get it working. If you want a fancy table, I promise it is far easier to build one using a fancy CNC machine than hand tools.

Answering questions you are unsure about - It is amazing to get a reply or answer very fast. What is not amazing is having someone tell you to edit your firmware to turn up the current or build the new machine when the fix was changing out a dull bit. So if you are not confident in your answer bare minimum is to lead with "This is just a guess", better to wait a bit to see if someone else jumps in so as not to causes added work for the new user that is probably very frustrated, or bummed thinking they broke something.

Spindles - You can add any tool that fits. A spindle costs more, needs firmware edits, adds mass (slows down the machine), and is notoriously sketchy in terms of electrical noise. You are adding a lot of complexity for the one added benefit of being not as loud as a router. All shop vacs are far more loud than a router, if you have fancy dust collection surely you hava a spare free trim router to use. On top of all that the power tends to be less than that of a trim router.

CAM Software - Anything that makes Gcode will probabaly work. Most people here have used ESTLCAM at least once. Estlcam is extremly simple to get working gcode from. If a user says they do not understand it... FusionCAM is not the answer to that. Getting started with ESTLCAM is great so we can all help troubleshoot if needed with the posted code or a screenshot. If they want to try something else, that is fine but support is extremely difficult with any other software do to the spread out nature of all the settings. Other software is not discouraged, just discouraged for the new user.
