## About V1
| The Lineup |
| ----------- |
| ![MPCNC](img/primo.png){: width="150" align=left} <br/> V1 Engineering Inc all started with the [MPCNC platform](mpcnc/intro.md), from there it kept expanding. |
|  ![LowRider CNC](img/Lr3.png){: width="150" align=right} <br/> All the same precision as the MPCNC but in a larger form factor for sheet goods? Welcome to the [LowRider CNC](lowrider/index.md). |
| ![MP3DP](img/MP3DP.png){: width="150" align=left} <br/> Have a shiny new CNC and not sure what to do with it? Make a 3D printer, [Milled / Printed 3D Printer (MP3DP)](mp3dp/index.md). |
| ![ZenXY](img/ZenXY.png){: width="150" align=right} <br/> Want to spice up your office, living room, or dining room?  Make a slick art table with the [ZenXY](zenxy/index.md). |

If you canâ€™t tell, I like to make things and share them. If you have any questions you will find me in the [forums](https://forum.v1engineering.com/). **- Ryan**

## About The Community Documents

These instructions are a collection of knowledge from the V1 Engineering community. They are
designed for collaboration in mind and edits are welcome. Please help us make this documentation
better.

**The [forums](https://forum.v1engineering.com) are a great way to get help. Please stop by and ask questions or share what you're
building.** This [Community Documentation](https://forum.v1engineering.com/t/community-documentation/11435) idea actually started in the forums. 

[This documentation is hosted on github.io](https://docs.v1engineering.com), [The source code is on github](https://github.com/V1EngineeringInc/V1EngineeringInc-Docs)

## Editing and Contributing

On any page, you can click on the little pencil in the top right to edit and contribute right from your browser (or you can use your git tool of choice).

??? "But wait, I don't want to edit source code, I'm not a programmer"

    *Great!* Programmers aren't always the best writers. We're using *MarkDown* which is more like word
    than a programming language. For the most part, the text is just text, and things like titles and
    pictures just need a few goofy characters to turn into titles and pictures.


That will take you to GitHub to the source for the page you want to edit. We use Markdown, here is some [markdown info](mkdocs_info.md)


![GitHub edit button](img/github_edit.png){width="300"}

In GitHub, there is a little bar at the top of the file with another pencil. If you click on that,
you will be guided to make the change and submit the changes back to the project. This is a
"Pull Request". After that, your changes will be reviewed, approved, and merged into the documentation, and
that way others can avoid the same problems you had.

Before you go, make sure you add yourself to the [Contributors](index.md#Contributors) section below so that everyone knows how
awesome you are for making a contribution.

??? "I want to develop more, faster, better, stronger"

    You can do some powerful things if you want to with mkdocs on your computer while editing the
    documents. There are some basic instructions in the [mkdocs info
    page](mkdocs_info.md#local-mkdocs)
