# About V1

V1 Engineering Inc all started with the [MPCNC platform](mpcnc/index.md), from there it kept expanding.

All the same precision as the MPCNC but in a larger form factor for sheet goods? Try the [LowRider CNC](lowrider/index.md).

Have a shiny new CNC and not sure what to do with it? Make a 3D printer, [Milled / Printed 3D Printer (MP3DP)](mp3dp/index.md).

Want to spice up your office, living room, or dining room?  Make a slick art table with the [ZenXY](zenxy/index.md).

If you can’t tell I like to make things and share them, If you have any questions you will find me in the forums.


# About The Community Documents

These instructions are a collection of knowledge from the V1 Engineering community. They are
designed for collaboration in mind and edits are welcome. Please help us make this documentation
better.

This idea started in the forums: [Community Documentation](https://www.v1engineering.com/forum/topic/community-documentation/)

The forums are a great way to get help. Please stop by and ask questions or share what you're
building.
