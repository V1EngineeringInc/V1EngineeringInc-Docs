# MPCNC Primo Parts

## Printed Parts Sizes
There are 3 different sets of printed parts C-23.5mm, F-25mm, or J-25.4mm (1 inch). The measurement is for the Outside Diameter of the conduit/rails/tubing. Please measure your rails before printing! 23.5mm fits ¾″ EMT conduit in the US. Anywhere else you must physically measure first. Some things are sold as Inside Dimension (ID) (conduit), or Outside Dimension (OD) (tubing).

Hardware store steel EMT conduit works well and is inexpensive; an upgrade would be .065” (max is 0.120") wall thickness stainless steel tubing or DOM. Stainless steel tubing is more rigid and smooth, but also much more expensive, Dom is less expensive than Stainless but requires some coating to prevent rust.

## Recomendations
Recommended Print Settings: PLA for dimensional accuracy (PETG is also acceptable, if your dimensions are verified good and you are willing to scrafice some rigidity). Two or more perimeters for through hole strength. There are some steep walls so no more than 75% layer height to nozzle diameter. 
**No support should be needed for any part I have designed.**

## Spindle Options

Currently I have made mounts for the preferred [Dewalt 660](https://amzn.to/2Z3yaHC).
Others options would be the [55mm spindle](https://amzn.to/2BsxX8S) (57mm caps), the least attractive option is the [52mm spindle](https://amzn.to/2BtIFvO).
