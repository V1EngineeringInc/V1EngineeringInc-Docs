## A Quick and Dirty Table

You can really use any table you have, the sturdier the better of course. If you don’t have a spare
table that you're willing to get really dirty, here is one I put together for a few dollars' worth of 2×4's.

I'd screw the table top on to keep it square, then cut the center out as a spoil board. That way it is
easy to replace without the need to disassemble the machine.
