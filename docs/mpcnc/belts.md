- Move the gantry all the way to the lower left corner.
- Paying attention to which way the cable tie heads are facing (for that slick clean look).
- For each belt, the first cable tie will be setup very loose, so that it can be tightened after the belt is routed, and the cable tie on the opposite side is tightened.
- If the gantry is oriented with the tool mount facing the lower left corner, it will be best to use the left side (when doing the front and rear belts), and the front side (when doing the left and right belts) for the adjustment cable tie.  There is more room on these sides, and the roller bearing cannot reach all the way to these edges.  If the gantry is oriented differently on your setup, you should use the side with the most room.
- Create a small loop on the end of the belt, just enough to fit a cable tie through the loop, with teeth facing each other and meshed, and the teeth for the rest of the belt facing down. Pull tight.
- Loop the next tie through this belt loop, and the corner piece. Leave this one as loose as possible (1″-1.5″ (25-35mm) gap).  This will be the adjustment cable tie, and will be tightened later.

- Move the gantry all the way to the opposite corner.
- Loop the belt (teeth facing down) under the first roller bearing, over the pulley, under the nest bearing.
- Set up the far corner the same as the first corner, with the exception of getting this loop of the belt as close to the corner block as possible.
- Make sure the roller bearing does not hit the belt loop. trim the belt.
- Repeat this all the way around, leaving the adjustment cable tie on the corner with the most room.
Opposites, usually the bottom left and top right. If you are setting up dual endstops it is best to
leave the adjustment on the side opposite the stop blocks.

- Now for the hard part. I have no way to quantify belt tension without a special tool (3-5 lbs).
- Make sure they are as equally tensioned as you can get them.
- Too loose, and you will have bad tolerance (everything undersized), worse case skip a tooth. Too
tight and the stepper will not move.
- It should not sound like a bass guitar if plucked and should not flop around when in motion. I’m
sorry there is no better way to describe this as of yet.
- The cable ties will form to the tensioned shape over a days time. So once you set them, the next
    day you might need to give them all one more click.
- It is best practice to add a tie to the longer one, this prevents the cable tie loop from
springing, but still lets it get adjusted. (second picture)

Last step
:   Please trim the cable ties. Such an easy step that so many people don’t do. You can trim
the tension ties the the outer edge of the corner so you can add a bit more tension but trim the
rest nice and short. It makes things look so much more finished….Pet peeve I guess.

!!! note "Quick note on the belts and cable ties."
    The GT2 belts we use are 6mm wide, and should be installed at between 3-10 lbs of tension (they
    can handle much more) and the cable ties are rated to 40lbs (it takes about 2.4lbs of force to cut aluminum…).
    This system is over kill, but the least expensive. There really is no need to go bigger on either
    part of this system, and consider there is one on each side of the axis so the actual force seen on
    each belt is half. You can not put enough strain on them to stretch them while in service.
