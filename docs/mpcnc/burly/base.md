## Feet

![!foot apart](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_115308.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* 3/4″ (M4 X 20), *-Foot_2018,  screw and lock nut, leg rail.
___

![!foot together](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_115352.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Insert the previously cut Leg into the Foot Bottom and loosely add the 3/4″ (M4 X 20) screw and lock nut. This will get tightened during the final step.
___

## Bottom Corner and Lock Corner

![!bottom and lock corner apart](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_115926.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner, ¾″ (M4 X 20) Scew and nut, optional Cyanoacrylate Glue.
___


![!bottom and lock corner together](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_120220.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Use the matching Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner parts. The direction of the letter will match when assembled of the correct set.
* Optional but suggested, add some glue to these parts before screwing together for added rigidity.
* Put the screw 3/4″ (M4 X 20) in from the corner piece and the nut into the lock and hold with a socket or pliers. This screw can get snugged down.
___

## Leg Assembly

![!foot and corner apart](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_120845.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* 3/4″ (M4 X 20) screw and nut, previous assemblies.
___

![!foot and corner together](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_120959.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Assemble the corners on to the Bottoms, add the screw 3/4″ (M4 X 20) and nut (nut goes in the hex shaped hole).
* Leave these screws loose, they will get snugged up in the final step.
* Repeat this for all four sets.
___

## Roller Assembly - Fixed Bearings

![!roller first three bearings](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_121442.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Use the 1.25″ (M8 X 30) bolts, lock nuts, 608 bearings, and the Roller or RollerM.
___

![!assembly of first three bearings](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_121655.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Nuts are best facing towards each other, unless you plan on adding mid span supports then the other way could get you some extra clearance.
* These can get snugged up, **don’t crack the plastic**, just snug.
* Do this for all 4 sets.
___

## Roller Assembly - Tension Bolts

![!roller last four bearings](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_123602.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* 2.5″ (M8 X 65) bolt, 608 Bearings, Roller or Dual plates.
___

![!roller assembled with plate](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_123933.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Use the 2.5″ (M8 X 65) bolt, run it through the Roller Plate (or the [dual plates](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2847042)).
* After the Roller plate add a 608 bearing.
* Add the plate and bearing stack into the Roller from the single bearing side. Only part way
* Add a Bearing into the center of the roller, and thread the bolt the rest of the way into the roller.
* Pay attention to the direction of the plate, **the stand offs should face the bearings**, and the extra notches should face the single bearing.

___

## Rollers on Rails

![!roller and rail](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_124453.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Previous assemblies, 5/16" (M8) Nylock nuts, X or Y rail.
___

![!roller on rail](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_124619.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* The nut for the 2.5″ (M8 X 65) bolt should be left extremely loose almost touching the roller but not all the way.
* Make sure these nuts don’t interfere with the small nut slots, if they do put the small nuts in now.
* Put all the rollers on their rails and make sure they all slide equally well. There should be tension when inserting the rail and all the bearings should touch.
___


## Roller Matched Pairs

![!matching pairs](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125042.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* This is showing the pairs for the X and Y axis. It should be one Roller and one RollerM. It does not matter which way the gantry rail angle is facing as long as it is facing the same as its counterpart.
* Roller and RollerM are just a mirrored set, made to help with printer deficiencies. Each axis gets one of each and the need to look mirrored (angle on the same side).
* When using the optional Dual plates, the long side should face X0 Y0 (nearest left corner)
____

## Lower Corner Assembly

![!corner parts](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125433.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Previous assemblies, Spacer_corners
___

![!rail on corner bottom](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125615.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Add your Y rails and rollers to the corner assemblies (front to back axes).
* Make sure the angled belt brackets face out, and the angles are pointed towards each other.
___

![!spacer placement](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125701.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Lay a Spacer_Corner on the rail.
___

![!upper rail on spacer](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125736.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Lay the X rail and rollers on next (Right to left axes).
___

## Full Corner Assembly

![!top corner placement](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_125916-400x300.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Top_Corner pieces, 3/4″ (M4 X 20) screws, and nuts.
___

![!top corner screwed down](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_130032.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Put on the Top_Corner pieces.
* Make sure the brackets are facing out, and the angles towards each other.
* Add the four screws 3/4″ (M4 X 20), and nuts.
* Leave the screws loose.
* Assemble all the corners.
* There will be a 2+mm gap all the way around.
___

## Check Base Dimensions

![!assembled base](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160823_131408.jpg){: loading=lazy width="400"}

* Set all your outer dimensions from corner to corner, Usually this is the same as your x and Y Rail length that was entered into the [calculator](../calculator.md).
* Lightly snug up the Top_Corner screws trying to keep the spacing even on all four sides of the part. **The parts do not require very much torque** the design holds the rails well.
* There will be a 2mm+ gap all the way around.
* Double check your dimensions, Be as accurate as possible.
