The larger    The rectangle you mark or further apart you measure the Z axis the easier and more accurate this will be.</li> <li>The difference of these measurements is the error in your build exaggerated to make it easier to adjust.

In this example if a positive value moves    the X1 stepper back by 0.72mm, a Negative value (-0.72), would move the X2 stepper instead.</li> <li>Test the value you just set. If the error gets worse change the sign of the offset (positive or negative). If the     error got better but not enough, increase the value. If the error is now opposite, you overshot. This will take a few tries.</li> <li>When adjusted to your liking you save the settings in your eeprom by running <code>M500</code>. These settings will stay after power     cycling but will be erased if you update your firmware. It is always best to take note of these settings. You    can confirm your settings by running <code>M666</code> in the terminal to see what is currently saved.</li> <li>If you move your endstops, tension your belts, or change your spoil board these settings can change.

So, for example, if you were at 0,0 and you were travelling to 100mm,100mm, and the feedrate was set to 100mm/s, it would travel at a speed of 100mm/s, but have 140mm to travel, so it would take about 1.4s to get there. If you sent the same command with a feedrate of 140mm/s, then it would take 1 second to finish that move.</p> <p>The limits on the speeds in Marlin are axis based. So if you set the max speed rate in X to 50mm/s and the max feedrate in Y to 50mm/s, Marlin will slow down this move to not exceed that speed on either axis. So the speed would end up being 70mm/s, and finish in about 2 seconds.</p> <p>So I use these terms in this document:</p> Feedrate The maximum speed along the straight line in gcode. Max Speed The maximum speed along a single axis. <p>Note</p> <p>In the past, some versions of Marlin have not protected against speeds higher than their max. All indications are the current Marlin (V1Engineering 418+) are responding well to adjustments in the max feedrate.</p> <p>Those total timing numbers aren\u2019t completely right. Because Marlin also doesn\u2019t go from a full stop to top speed instantly. It will use the acceleration values to decide how quickly to ramp up the speed to its top speed. So this move that takes 2s and maxes out at 50mm/s in each direction will actually take a bit longer, because it will start out slower, and work its way up to 50mm/s. Then at the end, it will slow down before the end of the 100mm, and stop smoothly. You can really see the effect if you drop your accelerations very slow. Movements are smoother, but they sometimes take a lot longer. The accelerations are also applied on a per axis basis, so on a high speed move, the X axis will be accelerating at its max acceleration and the Y will be accelerating at its max acceleration. The total acceleration on a compound move will be higher along the line.</p> <p>Jerk, or Junction Deviation are used because even on the corner of a square, you don\u2019t want to stop completely.

You shouldn\u2019t allow the machine to go so fast that it skips steps when not cutting material.

And it also needs to be able to set the \u201czero\u201d location to set up the cut. In dual endstop machines, it should also be able to command the homing sequence (Most CNC machines don\u2019t need endstops like 3D printers because the start location is on the workpiece, not the machine).</p> <p>The most simple method is to use the built in web interface on the Jackpot CNC controller or the  included LCD on the SKR Pro, which will take an onboard SD card. You can put the file on the SD card, and set the whole thing up on the LCD, and play the file without bringing a computer into the shop.</p> <p>The other simple method to do this is with Repetier-Host or CNC.js.</p> <p>There are many other advanced ways to send gcode.

The Z endstops are adjustable so there can be slight differences in each side\u2019s homing location. This adjustment lets you dial in the Z home location at each end of the beam as compared to your table. Most people do not need crazy Z accuracy but you do want to make sure it is pretty close. Getting under 0.1mm difference is pretty easy with this method.  To take this a bit further most Z accuracy critical projects have you surfacing your material so this step is not critical as that will get the surface as flat as possible. </p> <p>You will need to do this again after you rebuild your beam with the strut plates but most likely it will still be very close. When the beam gets rebuilt you can surface your entire work surface to level the entire thing, but most reasonably flat tables do not need this to be done.</p> <p>The basics are take a few measurements at each end in the same place, average each side\u2019s position, then adjust the Z offset to account for the difference. The side with the more negative number gets adjusted. The more negative the number the higher that endstop is triggering. After the adjustments, save your config, reboot, and test it one more time. Again, this number is not as critical as it may seem to some.</p> <p>This is a little gcode to automate some of this on the Jackpot board. Move to the x and Y location you want to probe at and run this to automate this a little. Run this several times at each position and average the position.</p> <pre><code>$HZ\nG10 L2 P0 Z0 ;set Z to zero\nG1 Z-70 F800 ;move down fast\nG38.2 Z-100 F60 ;probe slow\n</code></pre> <p>The advanced way to do this in FluidNC is run Jason\u2019s Gcode script.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Z leveling is a bit easier than the Y axis if you have a touch plate. You can also use any sort of block or piece of paper as a feeler gauge.</li> <li>I move 30-50mm in from each edge when I test, front and sides.</li> <li>If you are using a touch plate you can tape it down to increase your accuracy.</li> <li>Home the z-axis.</li> <li>Set the Z position to 0, in FluidNC that is G10 L2 P0 Z0, in Marlin that is G92 Z0.</li> <li>Very slowly, Probe to the touch plate (or whatever feeler gauge you are using).</li> <li>In Fluid NC probe to a touchplate looks like this, G38.2 Z-100 F60, in Marlin it is G38.2 Z0</li> <li>Make note of the current Z position, do this at least 3 times on each side and average the position.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>In FluidNC this is your current Z position</li> <li>In marlin this will say on your LCD screen, or your gcode sender.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Repeat this for the other side.</li> <li>Make sure to always hold or tape down your touch plate during this test for the best accuracy.</li> <li>Again, repeat 3 times and average your location.</li> </ul> <p>At this point you take the difference and adjust the side that is more negative. If I got -97 for Z0, and -98 for Z1, The difference is 1mm. I would add 1mm to the pulloff setting for Z1. We use a 4mm pulloff in FluidNC as the default so in this case you would change that to 5mm. This will make the axis trigger and reverse 5mm from the endstop trigger point. We need at least 4mm for the trigger to reset so never make is smaller. Save your settings, power cycle your control board, then retest each side at the same locations one time to verify the settings are good (under 0.5mm difference for most common use).</p> <p>For Marlin you adjust your settings with M666 Z1 This moves the right side down, or M666 Z-1 or this moves the left side down. Then you need to do an M500 to save your settings. Power cycle and retest each end at the same positions.</p>"},{"location":"lowrider/#making-the-strut-plates","title":"Making the Strut plates","text":"<p>At this point you should be ready to make some cuts, you should have made your own gcode and done a few test cuts to get familiar with everything. </p> <p>Those links in case you need to reference them.

You will see lots of images of people attaching cable chains, wires, and vacuum hoses to the motor mount. This is the absolute worst place on the entire machine to attach anything! It will act as a torque multiplier and completely ruin your accuracy/precision. Anything necessary should be attached to the main gantry assembly there is lots of room on the XYZ piece.</p> <p> </p> <p>The tool mount piece uses either #6 lock nuts or M4. Insert the nuts facing the right direction and if they are not a snug fit a tiny drop of glue in the corner will keep them from falling out. I add one after they are inserted right at the corner of each nut just to be safe. I use cyanoacrylate gel. It is not doing anything other making sure they do not fall out when not in use, if they are in use they do not depend on the glue at all.</p> <p> </p> <p>Insert the 4 nuts into the nut traps, if they aren\u2019t a tight fit a drop of glue here will help in assembly later.</p> <p> </p> <p>Insert the nut traps into your cut and drilled Z rails, pointed end up. Align the holes. Get all four screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) started but leave them extremely loose for a later alignment step.</p> <p> </p> <p>Press the bearing into the Z-Lower bracket. Make sure it is seated all the way and not crooked.</p> <p> </p> <p>Tighten the coupler onto the shaft, first tighten grub screw on the stepper shaft flat spot, then the grub screw on the round part. Make sure the shaft is most of the way into the coupler as shown in the cutaway. Use 3 M3x10mm screws to attach the stepper to the Z-Motor bracket.</p> <p>Do not insert the Lead Screw yet. The picture is to show you how far the shaft should be set.</p> <p></p> <p>Use no screws on the Z mounts yet. Slide the Z-lower bracket onto the z rails open bearing side will face away from the tool mount. Slide it all the way to just above the tool mount. Next add the motor mount. This step lets you align the rails and snug up the tool mount 4 screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20). Snug, if you hear a crack you went overboard.</p> <p> </p> <p>Slide the lower tool mount to where it just touches the coupler but does not compress it at all.</p> <p>IMPORTANT STEP</p> <p>Make sure the coupler touches the bearing so it can support the weight of the tool. We are using the ball bearing as a thrust bearing (not the right type of bearing but it is a tiny load).</p> <p>At this point hang the assembly off the edge of a table. Make sure the rails are sitting flat on the table, if it is not loosening, push down on the rails, and tighten the tool mount screws. If the rails are twisted it will rock back and forth\u2026that is bad.</p> <p> </p> <p>Try to get the gap between mounts to be relatively equal while still touching the coupler and bearing. This dimension will be different for every build. Check again, are the rails still flat?</p> <p> </p> <p>Add the screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nuts to the Z brackets, snug slightly.</p> <p>Snug slightly means, less than you think. If it is too loose at some point the mounts could move up and is very easily noticed and is easily fixed by going a very tiny bit snugger. If they are too tight you will crack the mount, not easily fixed. Err on the side of too loose.</p> <p>Check again, are the rails still sitting flat? Add the lead screw into the coupler. The lead screw should touch the motor shaft to fight thrust in the other direction from the lower mount bearing. Again, not the best engineering solution but it works great with this light load. The lead screw should be at least as long as the calculator specifies, but no longer than the bottom of the Z rails.</p> <p>If you are having a hard time getting the lead screw through the bearing, lightly sand or file the top 25mm (1\u2033) or so of the lead screw. It can be a tight fit.</p> <p>Lube the lead screw.

You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic!</p> <p></p> <p>So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be.</p> <p> </p> <p>The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this one step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero.</p> <p></p> <p>These are the dimensions I will be using for the depths of cut.</p> <p></p> <p>The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm into the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface.</p> <p>For the cut I select Inside, pocket, and selected the outermost path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one.</p> <p></p> <p>The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as seen in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red.</p> <p>Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm)</p> <p> </p> <p>Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm</p> <p></p> <p>Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily be snipped off. For this step will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set.</p> <p> </p> <p>Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam than stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode.</p> <p></p> <p>This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the files I used; you will probably need to edit these unless your wood is 11.5mm thick.

This is one of the parts for this http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1562144</p> <p>Intermediate</p> <p>Here is a video of this exact cut.</p> <p>Now to make the other side of the case, flip the tool paths in estlcam (you might have to realign the tabs) and delete the SD card cuts.

When you un-bundle the file each operation will appear as a separately titled bit of code so you can manually simply start each in your own time.   The gcode link will give you all of the operations in one bundle of code.</p> <p>While that\u2019s sinking in, whizz back to the Output menu and check that the Tool Init box is checked, unless you have an automatic tool changer, in which case it should not be checked, but if you have a tool changer, you probably aren\u2019t reading this beginner\u2019s guide! </p> <p>With that done, let\u2019s get back to our the operations menu at the bottom of the page and unnecessarily over-complicate things in the interest of science.</p> <p>Add four pocket operations and an outline. </p> <p>If we change our mind about how we want things to work, we have the ability to select individual parts of the project as separate operations, and we can experiment and rearrange the order of those operations simply by sliding the tabs on the bottom of the screen into a different order.   </p> <p></p> <p>In the image above, I have clicked the + button and added the face of the lettering as my first operation.

When this operation has been completed Kiri:Moto will know there is a tool change required and pull our code snippet in where it\u2019s needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Next, for demonstration purposes, I\u2019ve decided I want the logo cut second, so again I\u2019ve opened the next pocket operation and selected just the logo, and I\u2019ve selected an end mill for this work, requiring that tool change.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>\u2026 and so on until the only thing left to do is cut the outline.

At higher speeds, the MIG tip may heat up and melt the plastic mount, and the bending load on the needle can break it at the top.

There\u2019s also the ERC TimSav machine and moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper, which are even cheaper and simpler, but harder to use for other things.</p> <p>Everyone uses fairly large motors, although the actual power used is very low, around 10-20W. This is largely historical, but it is useful to have a motor with a short shaft and threaded holes to bolt on the flywheel. To minimize vibration, you want the ecentric needle bearing fairly close to the motor bearing. Long shafts and collet adapters will require lower speeds. Motors of around 1000-1200kV work well. Faster motors need to run at very low throttle, where ESC and servo testers may have poor resolution, and the RPM may hunt or surge.</p> <p>The (3mm inside diameter) bearings can be harvested from broken motors, or a pack of 10 is about $2 on eBay. Washers must be small enough to not touch the outside (moving) part of the bearing. You can either start with smaller (M2.5) washers, super-glue them to some scrap wood and drill them out to 3mm, or start with 3mm washers, clamp them to a bolt and hold that in a cordless drill and run them against an abrasive wheel.</p> <p>There are various ways to attach the needle to the top bearing, but by far the easiest is the 3D printed collar in moebeast\u2019s Foam Ripper</p> <p>An alternative is to enclose the bearing in the flywheel, with a free-wheeling bolt. Attaching the needle to the bolt is much easier than to a smooth bearing. The Onshape model (for a 2822 motor) is public and can be accessed here.

Diode lasers are much more compact, have self-contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit.  These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens, but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller.</p> <p></p> <p>Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood.</p>"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#power","title":"Power","text":"<p>Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut, or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about its power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum.</p> Wattage The overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of  grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers cannot be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice; a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours."},{"location":"tools/lasers/#air-assist","title":"Air Assist","text":"<p>To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor. If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way.

If you intend on cutting metal you should limit the bed size as small as possible and only increase it as you gain experience.</p> <p>First of all, before you run any program in metal, make sure your CNC mill is tight. For the MPCNC, check all of the bearings to make sure that they are touching a metal tube. No free spinning bearings that do not touch the rails. No exceptions. Then lock the motors in, grab the core, and try to move it around. Look for any movement and try to determine where it is coming from. If your machine is not tight, cutting metal will be a very frustrating experience. Watch it closely as it runs. If you see a cut start to deteriorate, it is most likely the machine loosening up or a tool that is dull. Sadly enough, the machine loosening up will cause the tool to dull.</p> <p>If things do start to loosen up over time, best practice is to reinstall the fastener with Loctite but do not over tighten.</p> <p>Follow the original assembly instructions.

You may not need to incorporate all of these strategies depending on the robustness of your machine but by using them you guarantee low consistent tool loads and no surprises. These become much more important when cutting ferrous metals like steel.</p> <ul> <li>Avoid plunging a MPCNC into metal. Always use a helical spiral when entering the metal from    the top. Endmills do not drill very well to start with, but if you do need to drill metal with an    endmill, you must go slowly. Another idea for smaller diameter holes is just center mark the    location of the hole with your CAM program and complete the drilling on a drill press. For starts    and stops you may need to drill access holes with a drill press. If you must plunge, limit the z    speed and depth of plunge as much as possible. You can deflect the rails enough to lift a router    by plunging too fast.</li> <li>Only use milling strategies that avoid loading the tool beyond the cut width you desire. A    Trochoidal (or adaptive) tool path is great for this. It avoids excess tool loads by limiting    cut width and by moving away from the cut on each tiny circle it cools the tool even more. It is    the best programming strategy for making slots, but it can be slow due to a large percentage of    the machine movement is not productive. A \u215b\u201d diameter endmill with 50% Trochoidal width and 8%    stepover will only advance at 5% of the feed rate. For this reason, you should be able to run    most Trochoidal cuts at the maximum feed rate of the MPCNC.</li> <li>Peeling is another good strategy you can use to minimize tool engagement. Just be careful    where you enter and exit the material and the corners.</li> <li>When changing directions in a corner some programs will push the tool into a 180-degree cut    width.

The footprint of the machine is the minimum dimensions needed to build it. The \u201cimage dimension\u201d is the size of the field the machine can produce designs in (the firmware number). The one consideration is the image area also contains the steel ball width, so \u201cimage dimension\u201d (X or Y) + diameter (one radius on each side) gives you the \u201cactual area needed\u201d.</p> <p></p> <p>This picture does not include the ball diameter, meaning it is 92mm from the edge to the center of the magnet. For example the offset (92mm) for a half inch ball (12.7mm) would be 92mm-6.35mm or 85.65mm to the edge of the work area (glass). Don\u2019t forget to also add some offset for the lip to support the glass. For table designs that are not exact fitting this doesn\u2019t really come into play. The calculator below does have this factored in.</p> <p>The height/thickness of the machine is 66mm plus the thickness of your spacers. Most steppers will protrude further than that. If you are planning on covering the bottom to keep fingers out, plan to have small stepper cutouts to keep thickness to a minimum.
